    "The problem is that, for one reason or another, a business or individual may wish to know a list of other neighborhoods that are similar to a given neighborhood, perhaps the one in which they are currently located. For example, a business may be seeking to relocate or open a second location, and it is satisfied with its current neighborhood and thus would like to replicate it as closely as possible. As a result, the problem will take as inputs neighborhoods from within Manhattan itself. The user would then be able to input a neighborhood and a geographic requirement, and the most suitable neighborhood given these parameters would be produced. In particular, the example that this particular problem will focus on will be businesses that have a target location to which they must locate as closely as possible, but this could of course be readily adjusted.\n"

    "The primary data in use is Foursquare. Information on other venues in the area will be collated with explore queries and used as a part of our similarity determinations. However, the website Rent Cafe is also scraped for average rent information by neighborhood, which seems eminently relevant to a business in terms of affordability concerns. While the values are residential, this listing is the closest to fitting the needs of the project and should at least provide a basic indicator of commerical rent. Finally, the table of all neighborhoods in Manhatten is also used, in addition to basic geographic data for illustrative purposes. "

    "Ultimately, machine learning was a primary driver of the project rather than statistical technique. The information available as described, including both typical venues and average rents, was used to produce clusters of similar neighborhoods using the k-means clustering technique. Datapoints in the same cluster as the input neighborhood were then compared with the desired geographic coordinates, and the neighborhood that requires the minimal distance to that point comprised the output, along with an overview of the neighborhood’s relevant statistics, which in this case were limited to neighborhood name, average rent, and distance from target"

For example, another sample function was produced that prioritized price rather than distance in its recommendation."

    "One interesting piece of information is the sheer quantity of different venue types that the Foursquare analysis returns. If recommendations were being made for a specific type of business, it would probably be helpful to remove some categories from consideration and combine others in order to produce industry-specific recommendations that are comprehensible to a human being. This type of additional data processing might also be helpful in ensuring that certain additional pieces of information receive due weight; for example, while average rent is fed into the k-means algorithm, it is difficult to tell how much this extra information actually affected the final clusters. Finally, the idea of extending this type of application to broader areas or to inter-city comparison definitely seems worth investigation."

The end result was a pair of slightly different Python functions that utilize machine learning in order to make recommendations based on some combination of rent, geographic, and venue data. The basic findings are also readily extensible in a variety of directions, and it can only be hoped that this project would provide a strong foundation for any such extensions."
